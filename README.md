SOMATCH is a data driven mobile app to simplifies your decision-making, encourages your self-expression, and helps you build cohesive, stylish wardrobes effortlessly.
### Background
Fashion is a cornerstone of self-expression and cultural identity, yet selecting compatible outfits can be a daunting challenge, particularly for those without a background in style expertise. E-commerce data reveals that fashion transactions surpass other categories by over 70%, underscoring the need to simplify outfit selection. The main challenge is creating cohesive and harmonious ensembles from separate items while balancing style and color.

To address this, we propose a data-driven mobile app with two key features. First, a fashion item recommendation system analyzes selected items and suggests compatible additions, helping users expand their wardrobe effortlessly. Second, an outfit compatibility feature evaluates the overall coherence of user-provided ensembles. These features simplify outfit creation, promote creativity, and empower users to express their personal style with ease.
